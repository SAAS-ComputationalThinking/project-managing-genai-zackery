Neat!  Cool project and the basic functionality works well.  I think I'm pretty slow at it.

 * Do you feel like you understand the code pretty well at this point?
 * Do you feel like you can add features without having to start over?
 * How was the GPT process for you? What would you do differently.
yes i under stand the code pritty well its just a lot of random number generation and changing styles in java script
yes i can add more fetures without starting over it would just be a litle anoying 
it was a fun progect but next time i would defintaly try being extreamily spesific with what i tell chat gpt becuase if it has options it alwas choises the most overcoplacated on
